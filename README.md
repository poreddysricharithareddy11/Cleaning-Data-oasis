# Description:


Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete
data within a dataset. Messy data leads to unreliable outcomes. Cleaning data is an essential
part of data analysis, and demonstrating your data cleaning skills is key to landing a job. Here
are some projects to test out your data cleaning skills:

# Key Concepts and Challenges:

1)Data Integrity: Ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data throughout the
cleaning process.
2)Missing Data Handling: Dealing with missing values by either imputing them or making
informed decisions on how to handle gaps in the dataset.
3)Duplicate Removal: Identifying and eliminating duplicate records to maintain data
uniqueness.
4)Standardization: Consistent formatting and units across the dataset for accurate analysis.
5)Outlier Detection: Identifying and addressing outliers that may skew analysis or model
performance.
